NOX 1.1 Oflib
-------------

This is an OpenFlow 1.1 [1] compatible version of the NOX controller.
The code is based on Nicira's NOX Zaku controller [2], with
OpenFlow proecessing being replaced with Oflib from the OpenFlow 1.1 Software
Switch [3]. The controller only supports C++ applications (no Python).
